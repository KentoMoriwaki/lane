# Changelog

All notable changes to `use-lane` are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `whenStale?: "revalidate" | "refetch"` read option for `useLane` /
  `useLanePromise`, controlling what a read does when the cached value is stale
  (older than `staleTime`). `"revalidate"` (default, the existing behavior)
  reuses the cached value and refreshes in the background; `"refetch"` discards
  an idle stale value (or a prior error) and suspends on a fresh load, but never
  discards an in-flight read or a value a live subscriber is showing.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `gcTime` moved from a per-`useLane` option to an instance-level
  option on `createLane({ gcTime })` — an instance-wide memory policy rather than
  a per-read concern. The per-hook `gcTime` (and its "largest across subscribers
  wins" rule) is removed.
- Garbage collection now runs as a single coalesced sweep per lane, armed only
  when an entry loses its last subscriber, instead of a per-entry timer armed at
  cache-set. Timing is approximate but the read path no longer arms timers; the
  lane-wide sweep also reclaims orphaned (never-committed) entries.
- **Breaking:** removed the `enabled?: boolean` option. Gate a read by passing
  `undefined` as the loader instead
  (`useLane(key, cond ? loader : undefined)`). Lane loads external data only, so
  an absent loader has no other meaning and is the single, unambiguous disable
  signal. Gating through the loader keeps the loaded type unaffected (the
  off-state stays on the `promise: undefined` axis, so `Awaited<promise>` is
  still `T`) and lets the loader's inputs narrow without a non-null assertion.
  Disabled reads still fetch nothing, create no subscription, and store no
  entry; supplying the loader is treated as a mount (re-subscribe +
  `refetchOnMount`).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- `enabled?: boolean` option for `useLane` / `useLanePromise`. When `false`, no
  loader runs and no subscription is created, and the result's `promise` is
  `undefined` (new `LaneGatedResult<T>`). Overloads keep callers that omit
  `enabled` (or pass `true`) at the non-nullable `LaneResult<T>`. Flipping
  `enabled` back to `true` is treated as a mount (re-subscribe +
  `refetchOnMount`).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-13

Initial public release.

### Added

- `useLane(key, loader, options)` returning `{ promise, refreshError,
  isTransitionPending, isBackgroundPending, invalidate }`, plus the
  `useLanePromise` convenience wrapper.
- `LaneProvider` / `useLaneInstance` and standalone `createLane()`.
- Exact and scoped (`prefix` / predicate) `invalidate`, `set`, `update`, and
  `remove` operations on the `Lane` instance.
- Invalidation-driven re-reads through transitions, with explicit (`transition`)
  and background (`focus` / `mount` / polling) sources kept separate.
- `LaneHydration` snapshots that overwrite authoritatively and notify mounted
  readers, so navigations surface fresh server data (RSC seeding).
- Stale-on-error: a failed refresh keeps serving the last fulfilled value and
  reports through `refreshError`; only initial loads reach the Error Boundary.
- Garbage collection (`gcTime`, default 5 minutes after the last unsubscribe).
- Loader context with `AbortSignal` (aborted on invalidate / remove / set / GC)
  and opt-in `retry` / `retryDelay`.
- Structural sharing so deep-equal reloads keep referential identity.
- Polling via `refetchInterval` (smallest interval across subscribers,
  settled-only ticks so pending reads dedupe).
- `refetchOnFocus` (window focus + `visibilitychange`, coalesced by
  `focusThrottleInterval`, default 5s), `refetchOnMount`, and
  `refetchOnReconnect` (`online` event) revalidation.
- `Date` key segments (serialized by timestamp, stable for invalid dates).
- ESM + CJS bundles with type definitions, preserving the `"use client"`
  directive.

### Requirements

- React 19.2+ (`useEffectEvent`).
